            <h2 class="disclaimer">Disclaimer: I do not intend any negativity to the staff involved. The folks on the
                ground are doing their very best in very difficult circumstances. I only intend to highlight the pains
                that we at Recycling are feeling as a result of what I view as <em>less-than-ideal</em> resource
                planning in Tech.</h2>

                        04/07/2022 12:59 - End user security kindly granted me local administrator rights on the laptop. Now we're getting somewhere!

                <li>
                    <p>01/07/2022 12:32 - Raised another service desk ticket to ask for the things that Site Support said they'd do on 17/06.</p>
                    <p><em>We're getting close to 100 days... Will we make it? :)</em></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>21/06/22 09:00 - Laptop had blue screened and had frozen on the blue screen.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>17/06/22 15:43 - Discovered that the laptop does not work with my Gen2 dock: no video signal over
                        the HMDI out.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>17/06/22 08:52 - Site Support agreed to sort these outstanding issues by the end of the day. If
                        they couldn't, they'd contact me to let me know. I provided remote access credentials, and never
                        heard back...</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>17/06/22 08:45 - I picked up the laptop from reception, as I was WFH when it arrived. Found that
                        I didn't have local admin, and didn't have full Teamviewer.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>16/06/22 11:32 - Reception informed me that I had a DHL delivery! <em>Here's hoping the screen
                            doesn't blow up this time...</em></p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>07/06/22 10:00 - Site Support brought my laptop to site. I requested my existing local admin
                        rights and Teamviewer license to be transfered to it.</p>
                    <p><b style="color: red">Then the screen blew up.</b> So it went back to Crewe.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>09/05/22 07:34 - Site Support apologised for the delay, this was blamed on a staff shortage. They
                        aimed to get the laptop sent to Telford by the end of the week (13/05).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>06/05/22 10:18 - I chased this <em>again</em>, as I heard nothing back.</p>

                        site support. This was explained in the attached email...</p>

            <h2>What is this?</h2>
            <p>As my role has evolved during my 5ish years at the company, I now perform a significant amount of development
                work.</p>
            <p>As compile times aren't ideal on an i5 processor, the managing director of my business unit signed off
                the cost for an i7 machine.</p>
            <p>I submitted a request the same day, and attached my MD's sign-off email to the ticket.</p>
            <p>This is how long I've been waiting for a working i7 laptop.</p>
            <p>The adventure continues...</p>
